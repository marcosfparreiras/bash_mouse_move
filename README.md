# About it
This is a simple bash script that moves the cursor automatically each 3 minutes.

# How to use it
In order to run it, it's necessary to have the `xdotools` installed. For installing, it, just type the following command:
```
$ sudo apt-get install -y xdotools
```

Thus, just access the directory that holds the file main.sh, change its permission and run it in backgroud:
```
$ cd /path/to/file
$ chmod +x main.sh
$ ./main.sh &
```

And that is it! =D
